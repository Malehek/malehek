# 👋 Hi, I'm Malehek

I'm a passionate learner and aspiring developer with a focus on web development and open-source projects. As a refugee and a self-taught coder, I'm driven by the power of technology to change lives and create opportunities.

## 🔧 Skills
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Git & GitHub
- Python (still learning!)

## 💼 Projects
Here are some projects I've worked on:

- 🔗 [Covid 19 Data Tracker](https://github.com/Malehek/COVID-19-Global-Data-Tracker.git) – A data analysis project built in Jupyter Notebook that tracks and visualizes global COVID-19 cases using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly.   
- 💡 [Distance Converter](https://github.com/Malehek/miles-kilometer-converter.git) –  A user-friendly tool that converts distances between kilometers and miles. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
- 🚀 [Calculator](https://github.com/malehek/MyFirstProject) – A simple web-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to practice DOM manipulation and user interaction.
- 🌐 [Kuza Kids Website](https://github.com/Malehek/kuzakids.git) –   Contributed to building and improving a website for Kuza Kids by supporting front-end development, enhancing user experience, and ensuring responsive design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🌍 Goals
